/**
 * A RoleSet is a kind of intermediate filter between an interaction graph and a
 * set of entities. A graph refers to sets of entities (that play a specific
 * role) but to make sure that a given entity can be referred to by more than
 * one graph, we separate the set that concretely hold the entities and the way
 * we access those entities in a graph. The RoleSet points to a concrete entity
 * set and maintains a subset view that is being used by the graph.
 * 
 * A RoleSet must be synchronized with the content of an entity store. It should
 * be notified if the content of the entity store changes.
 * 
 * Implementations of the RoleSet interface should provide at least two
 * constructors : one empty constructor and one that takes an Iterable<R> for
 * argument.
 * 
 * If the empty constructor is used, the setEntityStore(Iterable<R>) can be
 * called later because we need a reference to a set of entities.
